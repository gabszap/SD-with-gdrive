# Stable Diffusion with Google Drive

## Notes
- Idk if this works on Colab, i use Kaggle, test by yourself
- My notebook is from [x1101](https://github.com/DEX-1101/sd-webui-notebook) 

  ## How to Start
  1. In the Kaggle, select ``File`` > ``Import Notebook`` > ``GitHub`` > type ``gabszap/SD-with-gdrive`` and choose the my notebook (*.ipynb extension)
  2. You need a ``ngrok token``, get it from [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken). You need register it first.
